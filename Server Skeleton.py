# Define the Server class to handle server-side operations
class Server:
    # Constructor method to initialize the server object
    def __init__(self):
        # Create a socket object for network communication
        # AF_INET indicates that we'll be using IPv4 addresses
        # SOCK_STREAM indicates that we'll be using TCP for communication
        self.sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    # Method to bind the server to a host and port and start listening for incoming connections
    def bind_and_listen(self, host, port):
        # The bind method associates the socket with its local address
        # Here 'host' is the hostname (like 'localhost' or an IP address) and
        # 'port' is an integer representing the port number the server will listen on
        self.sock.bind((host, port))
        # The listen method enables the server to accept connections
        # It makes the server listen for incoming connections from clients
        self.sock.listen()

    # Method to accept a new connection
    def accept_connection(self):
        # The accept method waits for an incoming connection
        # When a client connects, it returns a new socket object representing the connection
        # and a tuple holding the address of the client
        conn, addr = self.sock.accept()
        return conn, addr

    # Method to deserialize the data received from the client
    def deserialize_data(self, data, format):
        # This method would contain logic to convert serialized data back into a Python object
        # The actual implementation would depend on the format of the data (binary, JSON, XML)
        pass

    # Additional methods would be defined here for decryption and file handling

# Example usage: creating an instance of the Server
server = Server()
# Bind the server to 'localhost' and a port number (9999 in this case)
# 'localhost' means the server will only be reachable from the same machine
# For the server to be reachable from other machines, you would use the external IP address or '0.0.0.0'
server.bind_and_listen('localhost', 9999)
# Start an infinite loop to keep the server running
while True:
    # Wait for a client to connect
    conn, addr = server.accept_connection()
    # Once a connection is accepted, you would add logic to:
    # 1. Receive data from the client
    # 2. Decrypt the data if necessary
    # 3. Deserialize the data
    # 4. Process the data (e.g., print to console or save to file)
